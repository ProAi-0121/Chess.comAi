# Umm, This is Chess.com Auto Bot using Stockfish, it doesnt uses selenium or any image detection.. using a extension it takes the data and sends it to flask server... then flask server stores the moves and gamestate in json file... and then using pyautogui we can make a move...

that was the idea... but later i realised the way i was taking the data from chess.com using the highlighted squares... i faced alot of problems and now i quit :/
